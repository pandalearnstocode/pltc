# About Me
Hi! I’m Aritra Biswas. By education, I am a Statistician (Data Scientist in millennial lingo). I work for The Nielsen Company. I develop analytical products that make market research easier, faster. I am from Calcutta but currently living in Bangalore, India. Outside of work, I love reading, traveling and blogging.

I have some old packages about YouTube text data in R, but I currently don’t have time and capacity to update, document and host. I might find a way around that in the future. If anyone is interested in contributing to that or any other open source project please feel free to reach out to me at [pandalearnstocode@gmail.com](mailto:pandalearnstocode@gmail.com)
