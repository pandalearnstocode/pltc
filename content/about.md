Hi! I’m Aritra Biswas. By education, I am a Statistician (Data Scientist in millennial lingo). I work for The Nielsen Company. I develop analytical products that make market research easier, faster. I am from Calcutta but currently living in Bangalore, India. Outside of work, I love to travel, read and write blog about various things.

I have one package about YouTube text data in R, but I currently don’t have a time to update, document and host it in CRAN. I might find a way around that in the future. If anyone is interested in contributing to that or any other open source project please feel free to reach out to me at [pandalearnstocode@gmail.com](mailto:pandalearnstocode@gmail.com)
