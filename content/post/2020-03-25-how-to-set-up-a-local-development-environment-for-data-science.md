In most of the places, I see a lot of blog post regarding the many case studies or implementation of models. But here in this blog post, I am going to talk about some basic stuff. I feel that this topic is quite important and in general, these are the things which are ignored in most of the cases. As a data scientist, we use IDEs all the times. This is important to configure IDEs correct to use gain the full potential of the IDE and the Programming Language. It does not only increases productivity, but at the same, it makes things easier. Here I am going to talk about two IDEs and Jupyter ecosystem.

<!--more-->

- Visual Studio Code/ Visual Studio Code Runner
- Rstudio
- Jupyter Notebook/ Jupyter Labs/ Jupyter Hub

These are the topics we will try to explore in this blog post.

### Visual Studio Code


Visual Studio Code is a lightweight IDE. It comes with the minimalistic setup, but most of the features can be included in this IDE as a plugin. Here is a list of things which has to be installed before installing and setting up Visual Studio Code,

- Anaconda distribution of Python
- R
- Rtools
- Rstudio
- LaTeX
- Docker

Here are a few videos which were quite useful for me, So Here I am sharing those. After the playlist, I will add if anything more needs to be added other than these.

#### Setup Visual Studio Code in Local with Python

Here in this video one can see how to setup Visual Studio Code in Mac. This process is quite same as Windows but there are a few additonal steps.

Here is the list of required steps to setup Visual Studio Code in Windows.

Here is a video which also shows the steps to get up and running with Visual Studio Code in Mac. This video has can be seen as a less number of steps than the previous one.

This is quite same as the previous video.

This video has some of the useful plugs required to make Python fully functional with the Visual Studio Code.

**Note:**

- If you are planning to use docker with alpine Linux, you need to use visual studio code runner. This behaves as the Visual Studio Code, but it has some more features to run Alpine Linux and connecting to the docker container.


#### Setup Visual Studio Code with R

Rstudio is the default option to run R nowadays. But in recent times Visual Studio Code is getting quite popular with R as well. Before configuring the Visual Studio Code for R here are the things which have to be installed on a computer. This is important to note that these things have to be installed in order,

1. R
2. Rtools
3. LaTeX
4. Rstudio

After these things are appropriately installed in a computer one can start to the process described in this blog [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/setting-up-r-with-visual-studio-code-quickly-and-easily-with-the-languageserversetup-package/) which say, how it is possible to get things set up in a Visual Studio Code with R.


### Rstudio

From it's genesis

### Jupyter Ecosystem
