      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;maintainability-code-with-wily&#34;&gt;Maintainability code with Wily&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wily is the tool of choice which will compute and maintain a measure of maintainability of a code in time. This can be important to check that a code is readable or not at a time of development. We all know that a piece of code evolves with time. So, this is important to measure the complexity of a code in time. Here we will see how we can set up this tool to calculate complexity of a code. Also, we will see how we can integrate this in the CI pipelines so we can ensure code quality in time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Record and share terminal session using Terminalizer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are great open-source tools are available to record screen. I personally like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.loom.com/&#34;&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt; and google hangout. All of these are good. But I recently came across Terminalizer to record the terminal session. It is easy to set up and use. Here in this session, I will quickly demo how I use this tool for document creation and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EDA is one of the most important part of any data science work. Recently I have came accross a library called pandas profiling which makes it easier and creates a beautiful shareable report. So, here I am sharing some resouces related to  the project which I feel can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Docker for Data Science</title>

      <description>One of the key problem which I have encountered while working in data science domains for couple of years is reproducibility. This is true for any form of research but it has special importance in data science domain especially if you are working with a code which will be consumed by others. If you are dealing with a code which is not reproducible then you can fix it but if your code is used by others there is no one to fix the problem which is not an error in true sense.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lets build a container based application which is optimized in terms of resources and integrate FastAPI with it. It will help to interact the app to connect to the internet and at the same time we will try to get the bast of data science stack in python. Here is the basic layout which we will try to achieve,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Python type checking using mypy</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;type-checking-in-python&#34;&gt;Type checking in Python&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;python-is-strongly-dynamically-typed-programming-language&#34;&gt;Python is strongly, dynamically typed programming language.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong&lt;/strong&gt; typing means that the type of a value doesn&#39;t change in unexpected ways. A string containing only digits doesn&#39;t magically become a number, as may happen in Perl. Every change of type requires an explicit conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic&lt;/strong&gt; typing means that runtime objects (values) have a type, as opposed to static typing where variables have a type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For details check &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11328920/is-python-strongly-typed&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>About Me Hi! I’m Aritra Biswas. By education, I am a Statistician (Data Scientist in millennial lingo). I work for The Nielsen Company. I develop analytical products that make market research easier, faster. I am from Calcutta but currently living in Bangalore, India. Outside of work, I love reading, traveling and blogging.
Somebody sent it to me on my birthday so I will go ahead and reuse this as shameless promotion material I have some old packages about YouTube text data in R, but I currently don’t have time and capacity to update, document and host.</description>
