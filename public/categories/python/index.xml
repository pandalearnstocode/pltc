      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;maintainability-code-with-wily&#34;&gt;Maintainability code with Wily&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wily is the tool of choice which will compute and maintain a measure of maintainability of a code in time. This can be important to check that a code is readable or not at a time of development. We all know that a piece of code evolves with time. So, this is important to measure the complexity of a code in time. Here we will see how we can set up this tool to calculate complexity of a code. Also, we will see how we can integrate this in the CI pipelines so we can ensure code quality in time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
