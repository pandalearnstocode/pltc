      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the essential aspects of coding is debugging. Reproducibility makes it easy to share a problem. I have personally seen that if we are stuck in a massive problem, making a smaller reproducible version of it helps in many ways. It is not always easy to think about the problem with a higher dimension of complexity, sometimes making it easier helps to understand the issue in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today R is completing the 20th year of its journey. I am thrilled and excited to share 50% of this journey. I started using R during my early college days. At that time, we used to write C code to solve various numeric problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
