      <description>One of the key problem which I have encountered while working in data science domains for couple of years is reproducibility. This is true for any form of research but it has special importance in data science domain especially if you are working with a code which will be consumed by others. If you are dealing with a code which is not reproducible then you can fix it but if your code is used by others there is no one to fix the problem which is not an error in true sense.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lets build a container based application which is optimized in terms of resources and integrate FastAPI with it. It will help to interact the app to connect to the internet and at the same time we will try to get the bast of data science stack in python. Here is the basic layout which we will try to achieve,&lt;/p&gt;</description>
