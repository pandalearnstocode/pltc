      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the essential aspects of coding is debugging. Reproducibility makes it easy to share a problem. I have personally seen that if we are stuck in a massive problem, making a smaller reproducible version of it helps in many ways. It is not always easy to think about the problem with a higher dimension of complexity, sometimes making it easier helps to understand the issue in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Automated documentation using pdoc3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Documentation of a project is one of the essential aspects in terms of maintainability. Here, in this article, we will cover pdoc3, a python library which can create documentation quickly without any bottleneck. This library is quite useful for creating documentation for backend or middleware in my mind. I find it challenging to use with math symbols in this, but document generation and hosting quite easy. Pdoc is quite easy to use in comparison with Sphinx, which is quite good with LaTeX symbol and other fancy things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are great open-source tools are available to record screen. I personally like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.loom.com/&#34;&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt; and google hangout. All of these are good. But I recently came across Terminalizer to record the terminal session. It is easy to set up and use. Here in this session, I will quickly demo how I use this tool for document creation and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
